Description: A helper for clients using an apt-cacher proxy server
 Apt-cacher (or apt-cacher-ng) is a caching proxy for downloading
 packages from Debian-style software repositories (or possibly from
 other types).
 .
 It's easy to proxy http connections through apt-cacher, but it's more
 complicated to proxy https connections. (See
 https://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~bloch/acng/html/config-servquick.html#config-client
 for more information.)
 .
 apt-cacher-client-helper is a simple tool that automates modifying
 apt's list files so that https repos also point to the apt-cacher
 proxy.
